# Operating Model

Adopting the cloud creates an opportunity to revisit how you operate technological systems. It is an opportunity to give greater autonomy to teams to carry out their work with reduced process impediments and therefore greater pace.  It is also an opportunity to define who is responsible for and therefore can specialise in different aspects of cloud.

Defining your Operating Model is there a key prerequisite to deploying or rationalising your cloud as this will inform how the infrastructure and supporting elements are built and managed. It also informs who needs to be on the journey and the key role that they play in its success.  Not defining a clear Operating Model can have negative outcomes such as poor security, out of control cost and increased complexity.
