# Managed Identities

Managed Identities negates the need to use passwords - or their equivalents - to connect to resources.

Resources can be created with System or User assigned identities and these identies can be given access to other resources.

For example
1.  App Service called *app-dev-hello* can be created with a System assigned identity.  It now has an identity of `app-dev-hello`.
2.  A storage account called *st-dev-hello-data* can be created and the identity of `app-dev-hello` can be given permissions to access it.

The code - that would run on the app service example above - for doing this is very straight forward:

```C#
var Uri = "https://" + storageAccountName + ".blob.core.windows.net/" + containerName;
BlobContainerClient containerClient = new BlobContainerClient(new Uri(Uri), new ManagedIdentityCredential());
```
