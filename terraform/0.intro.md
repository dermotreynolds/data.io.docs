# Terraform Introduction

Terraform allows you to define and build infrastructure as code.  So, rather than going to the cloud portal you can define the configuration of your infrastructure in code and run it.
If you want to change the infrastructure you can update the code and rerun it.

These changes can be version controlled and approved by your peers before they are applied.
