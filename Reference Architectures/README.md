# Reference Architectures

Microsoft - and other cloud vendors - have a multitude of reference architectures.

These should be the first port of call when determining how an application should be architected.

Generally they cover aspects such as:
- Components

    These should link back to your cloud patterns.
- Availability
    
    This should be based on your Non Functional Requirements.
- Performance
    
    Also based on your Non Functional Requirements.
- Security
    
    Specific security nuances of the architecture.
