# Strategy

Before embarking on your Cloud transformation journey you need to develop a strategy that answers fundamental questions such as why you are on the journey and what your vision is.

Your strategy will inform how you execute, architect, manage and prioritise your Cloud implementation.  These answers will also help guide you when addressing naturally occurring conflicts.

The key steps which you need to execute in order to define your strategy are:

1.  [Define and document your motivations:](##Motivations) Meet with key stakeholders and executives to document the motivations behind cloud adoption.
2.  [Document business vision:]() Engage motivated stakeholders and executives to document specific business outcomes.
3.  Evaluate financial considerations: Learn how to use the cloud to make your IT cost structure more flexible. Then, build a business case to adopt the cloud.
4.  Understand technical considerations: Discover the technical flexibility, efficiencies, and capabilities that help you build a business case to adopt the cloud.
